## Java Stricker Maker

Sticker Maker is a proof-of-concept project written in Java that leverages various APIs, such as NASA and IMDB, to retrieve images and add titles to the bottom of them. The project showcases the application of object-oriented programming principles, including the use of classes, methods, getters, setters, enums, and interfaces. Additionally, the project employs JSON parsing using regex, among other techniques, to achieve its functionality.

## Folder Structure

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `asset`: the folder to inject stickers (if not found, add 'asset' directory to root)
